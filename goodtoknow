so some of the things that you might do well to remember: 

tmux: 	
	C-a is the prefix 
	C-a : split view horizontally 
	C-a % split view vertically 
	C-a [ is scroll 
	
	C-h/j/k/l is to move around 
	note that this works for vim splits too 

vim : 
	:colo 		the colorscheme 
	:ls 		list buffers
	:b# 		go to buffer 
	:scriptname	list plugins  

	nerdcommenter
		<leader> is \ 
		cc to comment a line out 
		cs to comment in a sexy manner? (use with visual mode to cmmnt out blocks)  
		c-space to toggle comment 

to use the display: 
	echo $DISPLAY (to check) 
	export DISPLAY=:0 
	also start xming (win -- xlaunch) 
	
git: 
	git config credential.helper store 		to store your credentials 
	git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 10800'
							store your credentials for 3 hours 

	or just do 

	git clone ssh://git@github.com/username/repo.git 
	
	and not have to do what you tried in the first place 
	if you've already done that and you need to change it

	git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git

	
	the main part of git: how to use it: 
	create new branch: 	git branch branch_name 
		checkout new branch: 		git checkout branch_name 
	 	now work as usual:	 	git add && git commit 
		fetch from remote: 		git fetch 
		one commit to rule them all:	git rebase -i origin/master 
	now checkout and pull from master: 	git checkout master && git pull 
	merge them together: 			git merge branch_name && git push
	delete your branch (optional):		git branch -d branch_name
